## ðŸ“„ Description

This website was built using [Ignite](https://github.com/twostraws/Ignite), a static site builder for Swift developers. Ignite offers an expressive and powerful API to build beautiful websites that work great on all devices.

Unlike other frameworks, Ignite doesn't attempt to convert SwiftUI code to HTML or simply map HTML tags to Swift code. Instead, it uses SwiftUI-like syntax to help you build great websites even if you have no knowledge of HTML or CSS.
